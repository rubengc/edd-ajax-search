Live product search for Easy Digital Downloads.

== Description ==

EDD Ajax Search is a very easy-to-use plugin for Easy Digital Downloads. You just need to install it and it's ready to work.

EDD Ajax Search creates a simple search form that shows you instant search results, by suggesting you products from your Easy Digital Downloads store that match your searching criteria.

Just start typing in the search input and a list of useful suggestion will be shown and the more you write, the more accurate search results will be. At that point you will only need to choose what you want.
